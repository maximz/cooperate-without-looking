=========================

**Simulation calculations and figures for the Cooperate With/Without Looking project.**

This Python module produces simulation calculation and figures for the Cooperate With/Without Looking project.

### Usage:

```
cd src
python cwl.py				# run using pre-calculated saved data
python cwl.py recalculate	# run using freshly calculated data

```

See `bin/` for the default saved data files (they are overwritten each time you run the CWL module with the `recalculate` option) and for generated figures.


**System requirements:** The standard Scipy stack (numpy, scipy, and matplotlib) must be installed. If they are not yet installed on your machine, [please see this link](http://www.scipy.org/install.html).
